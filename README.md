## Getting Started
1. Start by forking the repo over on Github.
2. Next, notice that there is a `Gemfile`. It only has one dependency in it, `minitest`. Go ahead and run `bundle install`
3. The repo comes with two files, `rocket.rb`, and `rocket_test.rb`. `rocket.rb` contains the `Rocket` class we'll be testing. Take a minute to look it over.
4. The other file, `rocket_test.rb`, is where you'll write your tests. For now its just a skeleton.
5. This is the part where you're let off the leash. Read through `rocket.rb`, decide what needs to be tested, write some tests in `rocket_test.rb`, and try them out.

## Tips
1. Remember to run your tests at every opportunity. Don't just write all of your tests back to back without running the file, and expect to run it once at the end.
2. If you're not sure how a particular method works, or what its gonna do, write a test! Tests are a great way to break down how the code works in the first place, and writing them can help your understanding of what's happening.
3. Don't forget to test the **positive**, **negative**, and **edge** cases. Don't just write one test per method and call it a day.
4. If you have to decide between writing too many or too few tests, choose to write too many. Once you have more experience, you'll figure out where to draw the line.
5. Be brave. Experiment. Have fun! Testing isn't rocket science. It's just about making sure that things work the way you expect them to.
